## How it works
This script is inspired by [BenRoe's rpi-magic-mirror-eink](https://github.com/BenRoe/rpi-magicmirror-eink), but is fully implemented in python.

The python script uses [pyppeteer (Python implementation of Chromium's instrumentation API)](https://github.com/miyakogi/pyppeteer) to take a screenshot of a website (usually a locally running instance of [MagicMirror²](https://magicmirror.builders)) and then renders the screenshot on Waveshare's 7.5" 3-color display.

## Requirements
- Raspbian Buster
- Waveshare 7.5 3-color epaper display
- Ikea RIBBA frame (13x18cm)

## Installation
- Enable the SPI is enabled by uncommenting the following line in `/boot/config.txt`:
  ```
  dtparam=spi=on
  ```
- Install some packages:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install git python3.7-venv python3-venv libatlas-base-dev -y
  # Make sure to check the script before executing the next part! You are about to pipe a script from the world wide web to bash! At least it's not root...
  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
  nvm install --lts
  ```
- We need an older version of chrome (as there are problems with the current puppeteer version and Chromium 74):
  - Create a sources list for stretch:
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/stretch.list
    ```
  - Add the following two lines:
    ```
    deb http://archive.raspberrypi.org/debian/ stretch main ui 
    deb-src http://archive.raspberrypi.org/debian/ stretch main ui
    ```
  - Add a default apt settings file:
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/default
    ```
  - Set the default apt release to buster by adding the following line:
    ```
    APT::Default-Release "buster";
    ```
  - Install the chromium version from the stretch repo:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt-get install -t stretch chromium-browser -y
    ```
- Install MagicMirror²:
  ```bash
  mkdir repos
  cd repos
  git clone https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror
  cd MagicMirror
  npm install
  # Ignore the electron install error (if it occurs) and install the vendor and font packages manually:
  npm run install
  npm run install-fonts
  ```
- Clone this repository:
  ```bash
  cd ~/repos
  git clone https://github.com/NickEngmann/rpi-magicmirror-eink.git
  ```
- Setup the Python environment:
  ```bash
  cd rpi-magicmirror-eink/ePaperPython
  pip install -r requirements
  ```

- Move to the project folder
```shell
cd ~/rpi-magicmirror-eink
```

- Install Node.js dependencies (inside the `rpi-magicmirror-eink` folder)
```shell
npm install
```

- Copy the MagicMirror² config, CSS and fonts into the MagicMirror directory:
  ```bash
  cp -r ./magicmirror-files/. ~/repos/MagicMirror
  ```
- Adjust the config to your needs (set calendars, weather info,...):
  ```bash
  nano ~/repos/MagicMirror/config/config.js
  ```
- Intall PM2:
  - Install the package globally:
    ```bash
    npm install -g pm2
    pm2 startup
    ```
  - Make sure to execute the command which is printed (DO NOT JUST COPY THIS, IT WILL BE DIFFERENT):
    ```bash
     sudo env PATH=$PATH:/home/pi/.nvm/versions/node/v10.16.3/bin /home/pi/.nvm/versions/node/v10.16.3/lib/node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 startup systemd -u pi --hp /home/pi
    ```
- Setup the automatic startup on boot for MagicMirror:
  ```bash
  # Make sure to execute the command which is printed
  # Adjust the path (if MagicMirror is not directly in your home)
  nano ~/repos/MagicMirror/installers/pm2_MagicMirror.json
  # Adjust the path (if MagicMirror is not directly in your home) and replace the command with `node serveronly`
  nano ~/repos/MagicMirror/installers/mm.sh
  # If your user is not 'pi' checkout these lines before:
  # https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/blob/master/installers/raspberry.sh#L223
  pm2 start ~/repos/MagicMirror/installers/pm2_MagicMirror.json
  pm2 save
  ```
 
- Start the script with PM2 and run it in the background
  ```shell
  pm2 start index.js --name "eink-update"
  pm2 save
  ```

## Configuration
Currently the script is configured by modifying the global variables at the top of [main.py](main.py).
The cron schedule can be adjusted in the [config.js](config.js) file.
